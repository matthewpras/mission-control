# Board Meeting Scheduling Functionality

## Overview
This functionality allows users to simulate a high-level board meeting when a topic is submitted. Each board member persona will provide one unique perspective or 'critical challenge' regarding the topic. After the deliberation, their input will be synthesized into a consolidated strategic directive.

## Requirements
1. **Input Mechanism:** Accept a topic submission from the user.
2. **Personas Involved:** Sophia, Ethan, Olivia, and Liam. Each will provide a perspective.
3. **Deliberation Process:** Simulate the meeting where each persona presents their critical challenge.
4. **Output:** Synthesize input into a consolidated strategic directive.

## Implementation Steps
1. **User Interface (UI):**  Create a submission form for users to enter the topic.
2. **Persona Logic:**  Implement the logic for each persona to offer their unique perspective.
3. **Synthesis Function:**  Develop a method to consolidate the personas’ input into a strategic directive.
4. **Notification:**  Inform the user of the outcome post-meeting.

## Example Workflow
- User submits a topic: "Expanding into New Markets."
- Each persona responds with a challenge:
  - **Sophia:** Challenges related to market analysis and consumer behavior.
  - **Ethan:** Financial implications and resource allocation concerns.
  - **Olivia:** Operational challenges in new markets.
  - **Liam:** Legal considerations and compliance issues.
- Output a synthesized directive summarizing the above challenges and strategic direction.
