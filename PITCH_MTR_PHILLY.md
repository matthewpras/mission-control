# University City Mid-Term Rental (MTR) Pitch - v1.0
## Target: Property Managers / Private Landlords in 19104

**Subject:** Professional Housing Partnership Inquiry - [Property Address]

Dear [Landlord Name/Property Manager],

My name is Matthew Prasanth, and I represent a professional housing group specializing in mid-term accommodations for the Philadelphia healthcare and academic community. 

I am writing because your property at [Property Address] is ideally suited for our professional guest housing program.

**How We Operate:**
We are not a "vacation rental" or Airbnb operator. We provide **30-90 day mid-term stays** specifically for:
*   Traveling Nurses and Graduate Students at UPenn, CHOP, and Drexel.
*   Academic researchers and rotating healthcare professionals.

**The Benefits for You:**
1.  **Guaranteed Rent:** We sign the lease as a professional entity, ensuring you never have to chase a tenant for payment.
2.  **Professional Maintenance:** To maintain our high standards for traveling guests, we provide professional cleaning after every stay and handle minor maintenance at our expense.
3.  **Low Impact:** Our tenants are vetted professionals and graduate students who are often working long shifts at the hospitals—they are quiet, respectful, and low-impact.
4.  **Lead-Safe Compliance:** We prioritize safety and only partner with owners who maintain Lead-Safe certifications, aligning with Philly’s 2026 housing standards.

We are looking to secure a 12-month lease with a corporate addendum allowing for our professional guests. I would love to discuss how we can provide you with a hands-off, "set-and-forget" rental income stream for this unit.

Are you available for a brief 5-minute call this week?

Best regards,

Matthew Prasanth
