# Real Estate Arbitrage Research: 2026 MTR Trends
Date: 2026-02-24

## Strategy: The Mid-Term Pivot
As cities tighten Short-Term Rental (STR) regulations, the "Sweet Spot" for 2026 is **Mid-Term Rentals (MTR)**: Furnished stays of 30-90 days. This avoids most hotel taxes and STR permits while maintaining higher-than-market rent.

## Top Tier-2 & Hub Markets for 2026
| Market | Strategy | Drivers | Est. Profit/mo |
|--------|----------|---------|----------------|
| **Cincinnati/Cleveland, OH** | Low-Cost Entry | Medical Hubs (Traveling Nurses), strong rental growth. | $800 - $1,200 |
| **Milwaukee, WI** | Mid-Size Pro | Corporate HQ stays, University research staff. | $900 - $1,300 |
| **St. Louis, MO** | Tech/Med Growth | Lower entry costs for arbitrage, growing professional base. | $750 - $1,100 |
| **San Francisco, CA** | High-End Hub | Tech/Startup workers (1-3 month stays), High ADR. | $1,500 - $2,500 |
| **Minneapolis, MN** | Stable Growth | Corporate HQ hub, research institutions. | $1,000 - $1,400 |
